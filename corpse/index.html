      <p>Once upon a time, on the first day of school, there was a lonely freshman wandering the halls. Nobody knew who this freshman was, and frankly he didn't know anybody either, but regardless he remains determined to get his degree. Walking through the halls, he avoids eye contact, so as to not have to interact with anyone at any time. He was shy, and he felt lost in this suddenly new world he just entered. But then, someone approached him. They began to speak to him. Was this a friend? An enemy? He wasn't too sure. But he decided to say hello, and they told him:...</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Lucas">
      <p>"Hi I'm Jerome are you interested in banana splits?" The lonely freshman didn't know how to respond. He stood wide-eyed and still. The student continued, "We're having weekly meetings for our banana split club starting tonight at 5:30." The student handed the freshman a flyer with the most beautiful banana split on it. "I'm actually lactose intolerant, do you have soy ice cream?", the freshman spurted out. "No, sorry this is a strictly dairy club."</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Meriah">
      <p>The freshman didn't know what to do with this information. He knew that he should probably try to start making friends, but didn't know if eating ice cream was the best way to do that. His mom had always told him to be careful around children who like ice cream. It was a 'gateway' dessert, and eating ice cream would lead to brownies and chocolate and the worst of all cake.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Joanne">
      <p>The lonely freshman had heard a lot about cake, and what it can do to a waistline, but in the spur of the moment he went for it. He sat down with a group of people enjoying the ice cream. At first it was scary, everything in him was telling him to stop eating the 'gateway' dessert, but there were just so many flavors! Strawberry, Chocolate, Vanilla, even one with all three called Neapolitan! After eating around 7 pints, his stomach began to grumble and he started seeing spots!</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Abbie">
      <p>Next thing he knew, he was laying on the ground looking up at the ceiling. His lactose intolerance had bested him once again, and he had fainted! Of course, a crowd of people had gathered around. They were most certainly concerned citizens, but the freshman just felt like he was being gawked at. After a few minutes of floor time, when he felt ready to be back on his feet, he grabbed one of the many hands that had been offered to him. He stood up, immediately sat down at a nearby table, and was joined by the person who had helped him up.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Ari">
      <p>"Hi, my name is Elise. Are you okay? I saw you lay on the ground there for 10 minutes, I thought you were dead." Wow, she was pretty. Long, flowy brown hair, bright blue eyes, and a smile unlike he'd ever seen before. Oh no, was he in love? He'd never met a girl before, and he didn't know what to say, but he knew that this is what true love felt like. "H-hi. I'm M-M-Matt. Its so nice to m-meet you", he says while nervously fumbling with his backpack strap. "Hi Matt. C'mon, let's get out of here. I've got tons of horses at my place, we should go ride them", she says, but Matt snapped out of his stupor the second she said "horses", for even he knew that horse girl energy was real, and that was definitely a RED flag. He turns to Elise, the raging horse girl, and says:...</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Lucas">
      <p>
        "Calm down with that horse talk –– we'll get to riding later." Despite her raging horse madness, Matt liked this girl. Especially her hair. "Your hair is fantastic." Elise thanked him and flipped her hair over her shoulder. This was the first conversation he had ever had with a girl besides his cousin Francesca who was addicted to huffing glue. "My cousin likes glue." She gave him a confused look. "I've got to get going. It was nice to meet you!" She walked off.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="Meriah">
      <p>
        As she walked off Matt wondered if Elise knew that her hair looked like a horses mane. Then he got to thinking that maybe that's what she was going for, because she loved horses so much that she wanted to look like one. This intrigued Matt because he had never met anyone who wanted to look like an animal. Even though he wasn't sure about this girl, he figured he would help her obsession with horses by giving her shoes that look like horse hoofs. Maybe that would make her like him as much as he liked her.

    <section class="Joanne">
        <p>Later on in the evening, Matt finally returns back to his dorm. To his surprise, his two roommates Phil and Lil, were axiously waiting for him on his bed. Phil, Lil, and Matt had been friends since middle school and if he had learned anything about them, he knew something was up. Matt asks "Why y'all actin all sus?" Lil then blurts ...</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Abbie">
      <p>"We heard you met a girl today! What happened?? How'd it go?" Matt relayed his fainting story, and Phil and Lil rightfully burst out laughing. "So what are you going to do now?" Phil asked. "Well, you guys wouldn't know anything about acquiring a horse, would you? If I get her a horse she's got to fall in love with me." Luckily for Matt, Lil had actually spent time working on a horse farm, and she still had connections at her old job.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Ari">
      <p>They hopped in Lil's fancy new Toyota Prius, and headed toward her old job at the horse farm. Lil showed Matt the basics of horse care, including grooming, feeding, training, and of course, riding. The horse riding was the most intimidating, as the horses at the farm were massive award-winning mustangs. Lil hopped on a horse, and told Matt to hop on a horse as well. Of course, Matt chose to ride the biggest baddest horse they had, a purebred mustang named Excaliber. This horse was so tall that Matt needed a step-stool AND a ladder to get on, but alas, he made it on the back of Excaliber. The second his butt hit the saddle, the horse took off running. Lil screams "Wait Matt NO!!" and chases after him, but Matt and Exaliber set out at unmatched speeds. Will she catch him? Will Matt die? What happened to Lil's Toyota Prius? Tune in next paragraph and find out.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Lucas">
      <p>
        Three days later – Matt had been riding for what seemed like eternity. He wanted to return to his friends but he had no idea how to control this obviously magical marathoning beast. Excaliber was running at a speed so great that all Matt could do was hang on for dear life. Matt tried to think of a way out of his awful situation.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="Meriah">
      <p>
        The more he thought the more he realized that there was no way out. So he figured that he would just embrace it. All of a sudden he got a surge of confidence and before you know it his body was covered in armor and he was holding a sword. Excaliber and Matt had now became the ultimate fighting machine.
      </p>

    <section class="Joanne">
      <p>He was now in battle, charging towards the other army. His name now Sir Matthew the third. He's battling for the legendary pokemon Mewtwo's respect. He charges straight past the opponents, missing everyone. He's shook. In awe, Sir Matthew the Third turns around and sees...</p>
    </section>
    <section class="Abbie">
      <p>Elise! Turns out she also worked on the horse farm, and she knew Lil from way back when. When Matt & Excaliber ran off from Lil, she had called Elise for backup. Together, Elise and Matt won Mewtwo's respect in battle. After that, they got married and lived happily ever after, obviously.</p>
