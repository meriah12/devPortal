# Exquisite Corpse
##Overview

This project is a group collaboration effort put together in out web development class. This was made to help us all understand the capabilities
of github and git. There are five of us in a group, one of us started writing a paragraph, and then the next person would read the paragraph
before them and then write their own paragraph. This would continue until all five people had written three paragraphs, with only the
paragraph written before them for reference. This creates a fun, whimsical story that could go anywhere.
