	<p class="text">Dearest GitHub how I adore you. I can't believe that you were hard to use at the beginning, and that I was just a tiny bit afraid of you... But you are so easy to use! Setting up a new repository is as easy as <b><font color="red">git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git</b></font>. My only problem is that you are a little bit <b><font color="red">push</font></b>y. You also <b><font color="red">checkout </font></b> really easily, but I love you regardless. <br><br>
	I also love how you keep surprising me with whay you can do, like the other day... You showed me that I can do project boards in GitHub, which I never thought you would be able to do. <br><br>
	Oh! And I almost forgot my favorite thing about you. The fact that all I have to do is type <b><font color="red">git fetch </font></b> and then you tell me all about the other people who have left comments on my repository. 
	<br><br>
	You're the best!!<br><br>
	Meriah
