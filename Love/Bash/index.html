			I don't know how to say this, but it needs to be done. I don't think this is working out. I thought that I could get past out language difference, but when you never bothered to learn that dir means the same thing as <font color="red"><b>ls</b></font>, I knew that you would never bother to really get to know me. <br><br>
			I should've known right off the bat when your <font color="red"><b>touch</b></font> did nothing for me. I think I stayed with you because I thought your file transferring capabilities were really cool, but I know now that I shouldn't have lead you on, and let you believe you would work for me, when I always knew that we would never really be enough for me. <br><br>
			I do wish you the best, I hope you can find someone who appreciates your <font color="red"><b>terminal</b></font> and can actully understand your <b>nano</b> command. <br><br>
			Best,<br>
