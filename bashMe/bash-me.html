<h2>A little about me</h2>
<p>
	My name is Meriah and I was born and raised in Colorado. I attent the University of Colorado Boulder, and am majoring in TAM. I also have two minors, Business and Geology. I am a massive procrastinator so it is a mirical that I can ever keep up with all my school work! <br> One "fun" fact about me is that I am an avid skiier,but did not actually learn to ski until I started college. <br> I do not really have any specific goals in this class except to learn as much as I can about web design because I am looking at it as a possible career choice.</p>
